# Accountancpy

![Coverage](coverage.svg)


A ~~destined-for-the-graveyard~~ project to create simple personal bookkeepping software with a Django backend.

Inspired by [HTMX](https://htmx.org/)'s philosophy that simple solutions can be sufficient for neat things, Accountancpy is built with HTMX for interactivity and [Tabler](https://tabler.io/) for UI.

It won't have deep accounting functionality, but the basics of loading expenses from the bank and assigning them to ledgers should be simple, quick and fun.


## Commit style

I try to prefix commit names as follows:
- `feat`: Adds or changes functionality
- `fix`: Fixes broken behaviour
- `visual`: Changes page style without changing functionality
- `test`: Adds or changes tests
- `style`: Changes code style without changing functionality
- `doc`: Only contains changes to documentation
- `dep`: Updates a dependency
- `dev`: Changes development configuration
